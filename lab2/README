Problems:
	1.	-char *cp;
		-char *ap[];
		-int **pp;
		
	2. I don't know yet
	
	3. In the for loop the condition " p != '\0'" falsely checks if the
	current address the pointer points to is the NULL character.
	It does not check if the content at that address is the NULL Character.
	What will happen when you execute it is that the for loop never stops
	and accesses memmory that it is not allowed to access (But at least
	it puts "Hello, world!\n" before that happens). Keyword
	Segmentation fault.
	One can fix it by dereferencing the pointer in the condition.
	-> " *p != '\0'"
	
	4.
