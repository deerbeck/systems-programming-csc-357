This program basically uses my code from hencode.
It is just modified to account for the simpleness needed for this lab.
It should do what it is supposed to do. At least all the Test cases 
succeeded with tryLab03 and valgrind did not show any problems.

The utility functions do not differ from them used by hencode and hdecode.

The code is commented to better understand what I was trying to do and what 
I ended up doing.
