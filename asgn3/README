To say this program was as easy as detab would be a straight lie...
But after many hours (>25) and much debugging and rewriting I think I got it
running.
At least it runs against all the test cases provided by tryAsgn3.
As well as no memory problems that would've been catched by valgrind.
I spent another rather large amount of time trying to improve perofmance here
and there and I hope I kept the reasonableness in it.

I commented most of my code to explain what I tried to do and what I ended up
doing.
But documentation is definitely not my strongest skill.
