Questions:
	1. unix4
	2. manpage on "man" - I learned how to add search paths to the man command using the -M argument
	3. I choose emacs, simply because it was the first you suggested in the lab1 instructions :). And I did not use any specific editor for linux before that.
	4. The program is supposed to output "Hello World!" to the output stream - so far no problems encountered
