It was hard to wrap my head around all the specification and get them right.
But I got there in the end.
Please consider that I finished this before Thanksgiving break, because like 
I already mentioned I was on a trip from Nov 17 to Nov 26.


I commented most of my code to explain what I tried to do and what I ended up
doing.
But documentation is definitely not my strongest skill.
